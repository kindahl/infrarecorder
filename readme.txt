The InfraRecorder source code can be obtained from http://infrarecorder.org

In order to compile InfraRecorder you will need the following libraries:
 1. WTL: http://wtl.sourceforge.net
 2. ckCore, ckFileSystem and ckMMC: http://code.kindahl.com
 3. libpng: http://www.libpng.org

InfraRecorder uses cdrtools, sources can be found at:

InfraRecorder has been developed with Visual C++ 2005 Professional edition. It
is however possible to compile the sources with the free "Express" edition, but
you will need to separately obtain and install the ATL library headers. The
Microsoft Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK (also free) was the last
Windows SDK version to ship with the ATL headers. The bundled ATL 3.0 is rather
old, but it is still supported by the latest WTL library.
